                C++ is an Object Oreinted Programming Language. It is known for its
                fast execution of codes. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup and his
                team at Bell's laboratory in USA. C++ is widely used for Game
                development, GUI based Applications, Web Browers, Embedded Systems,
                Banking Applications, Compilers, Database Management Software and many
                others.
            </p>
            <p>
                C++ supports the concepts of Object Oriented Programming, which are;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Abstraction(Data Hiding):
                    <p>
                        Showing only the essential parts and hiding the implementation
                        details

                </li>

                    <p>
                        This means binding variables and methods under a single entity.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p>
                        It means acquiring the properties of one class to anther class.

            <p>
                As the name C++ implies, it was derived from C programming language
                and the '++' in 'C++' is the increment operator in C. The aim was to
                have as many compiler vendors and computer software developers as
                possible agree on a unified description of the language in order to
                avoid the cofusion caused by many languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                C and C++ are two different languages entirely, C supports Traditional
                Procedural Programming while C++ supports Object Oriented Programming
                concepts. In Traditional Procedural Programming, data and fuctions are
                kept seperate from the data they process and this had a significant
                way a program handles data. Object Oriented programming is a way of
                computer programming that is based on an idea of objects ot represent
                data and methods(attributes and fuctionalities). C++ supports C
                fucntionality and most C codes can be reused in C++ but not all C++
                will work in C programmming language.

            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>
                To get started with writing C++, Open a code editor and save file with
                a '.cpp' extension and write your first Hello World C++ code:
            </p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>#include &ltiostream&gt
            <br />
            using namespace std;
            <br />
            int main(){
            <br />
            cout &lt&lt"Hello World" &lt&lt endl;
            <br />
            return 0;
            <br />
            }</code>
            </div>
            <p>When you run the program on your console, your output will be:</p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>Hello World</code>

            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A C++ identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar
                sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                C++ is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A"
                through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                (lowercase). Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.

            </div>
            <p>This syntax is used to assign the variable to a value on declaration.</p>

            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is

        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is
                the same as
                for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
                alphabetic, numeric,
                or underscore characters</p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            </div>
            <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has
                to be
                initialized to a value.

                The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword
                is omitted, the
                identifier is assumed to represent a variable.

                You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="if_and_else_statement">
            <header>if and else statement</header>
            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause
                to execute a
                statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { 
                <br>
                statement_2; }</code>
            </div>
            <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
                evaluates to
                true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is
                executed. statement_1
                and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
            <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
                follows:</p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
            statement_last; }</code>
            </div>
            <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be
                executed. To execute
                multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to
                always use block
                statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>if (condition) { 
                <br>
                statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                <br>
            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                <br>
            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
            <br>
            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
            </div>
            <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
                confused with
                equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            </div>
            <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
                parentheses around
                the assignment. For example:</p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            </div>
            <p></p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="While_statement">
            <header>While statement</header>
            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
                statement looks as
                follows:</p>
            <div id="code-bg">while (condition) statement</div>
            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following
                the loop.</p>
            <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                statement is executed
                and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed
                to the
                statement following while.</p>
            <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>int n = 0; int x = 0; 
                    <br>
                    while(n &lt 3){
                        <br>
                        x += n;
                        <br>
                        n++;
                        <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x andd n take on the
                following values:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
            <header>Function declarations</header>
            <p>A fuction definition (also called a fuction declaration, or fuction statement) consists of the void
                keyword, followed by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and seperated by commas.</li>
                <li>The C++ statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {}.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example the following code defines a simple funtion named square:</p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>void square(number)
                    <br>
                    {return number * number;
                    <br>
                }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says
                to return the
                argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the
                value returned by
                the function.</p>
            <div id="code-bg">
                <code>return number * number;</code>
            </div>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
                function, but if
                the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling
